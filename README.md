# Z-Cam-S1
Ressources, docs and more
This is a personal documentation about the VR Camera Z-Cam S1.
I am using github to collect informations about the camera, her tools, her tips & tricks.

Feel free to propose new information. This documentation will stay free and open.

You can reach me at fpierron (at) crunchyvisio.com or in the Z-Cam-S1 group on Facebook
